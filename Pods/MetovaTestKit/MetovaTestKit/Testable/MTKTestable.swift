 The MTKTestable protocol provides an alternative, functional approach to `XCTest`'s built in `setUp` & `tearDown` methods for handling unit tests.
 
 `instanceForTesting()` should provide a new instance for each call.
 
 `test(_:)` should effectively follow this pattern:
 
     static func test(_ testBlock: (Self) -> Void) {
 
         let testInstance = instanceForTesting()
 
         // any code that would previously live in setUp
 
         testBlock(testInstance)
 
         // any code that would previously live in tearDown
 
     }
 
 With these methods implemented, our test cases now look like this:
 
     func testThings() {
 
         FooBarClass.test { testInstance in
 
             XCTAssertNil(testInstance.thingThatShouldBeNil)
 
         }
 
     }
 
 This allows `setUp` & `tearDown` code to exist across multiple files. Moreover, `setUp` & `tearDown` logic could now be inherited. As well, `MTKTestable` protocol extensions could be written to generalize some of the `setUp` & `tearDown` logic for large collections of types.
 
 - Note 
 `UIViewController` and its subclasses get a free implementation of `test(_:)` as long as they have implemented `instanceForTesting()`. The default `test(_:)` implementation for view controllers calls `loadView()` and `viewDidLoad()` before running the `testBlock`.
