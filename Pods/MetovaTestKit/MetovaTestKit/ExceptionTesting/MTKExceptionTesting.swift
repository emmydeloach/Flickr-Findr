 Synchronously tests the provided block for exceptions. If it would throw an exception, the exception is caught and the test fails. Otherwise, the test passes.
 
 - parameter message:   The message to log upon test failure.
 - parameter file:      The file the test is called from.
 - parameter line:      The line number the test is called from.
 - parameter testBlock: The block to test.
 
 - returns: The caught exception. If no exception was thrown, returns `nil`.
 
 - warning: You should not rely on `XCTestExpectation` fulfillment in this block. If an exception is thrown before fulfillment, the expectation will never be fulfilled. `XCTestExpectation` should be unnecessary as the block is executed synchronously.
 
 - warning: This will only catch Objective-C-style exceptions. Swift's `fatalError`s are not caught by this test.
