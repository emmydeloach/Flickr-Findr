 Synchronously tests the provided block for exceptions. If it would throw an exception, it catches the exception and returns it.
 
 @param testBlock The block to test.

 @return The caught exception. If no exception was thrown, returns `nil`.
 
 @warning You should not rely on `XCTestExpectation` fulfillment in this block. If an exception is thrown before fulfillment, the expectation will never be fulfilled. `XCTestExpectation` should be unnecessary as the block is executed synchronously.
 
 @warning This will only catch Objective-C-style exceptions. Swift's `fatalError`'s are not caught by this test.
